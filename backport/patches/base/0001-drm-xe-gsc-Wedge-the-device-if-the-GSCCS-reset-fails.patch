Subject: drm/xe/gsc: Wedge the device if the GSCCS reset fails

Due to the special handling of the GSCCS in HW, we can't escalate to GT
reset when we receive the reset failure interrupt; the specs indicate
that we should trigger an FLR instead, but we do not have support for
that at the moment, so the HW will stay permanently in a broken state.
We should therefore mark the device as wedged, the same as if the GT
reset had failed.
