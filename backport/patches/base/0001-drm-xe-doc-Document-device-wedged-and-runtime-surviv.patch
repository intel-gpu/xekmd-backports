Subject: drm/xe/doc: Document device wedged and runtime survivability

Add documentation for vendor specific device wedged recovery method
and runtime survivability.

v2: fix documentation (Raag)
v3: add userspace tool for firmware update (Raag)
v4: use consistent documentation (Raag)
v5: add more documentation
