#
# This file specifies which sources are copied from the kernel
# into the backports package.
#
# Directories must end with a slash (e.g. "net/wireless/") and
# are then copied with all their contents.
#
# It is also possible to rename while copying, to do so list
# old name -> new name
# Note that in this case the spaces are needed: " -> "
