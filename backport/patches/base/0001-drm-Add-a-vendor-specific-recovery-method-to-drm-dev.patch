Subject: drm: Add a vendor-specific recovery method to drm device
 wedged uevent
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Address the need for a recovery method (firmware flash on Firmware errors)
introduced in the later patches of Xe KMD.
Whenever XE KMD detects a firmware error, a firmware flash is required to
recover the device to normal operation.

The initial proposal to use 'firmware-flash' as a recovery method was
not applicable to other drivers and could cause multiple recovery
methods specific to vendors to be added.
To address this a more generic 'vendor-specific' method is introduced,
guiding users to refer to vendor specific documentation and system logs
for detailed vendor specific recovery procedure.

Add a recovery method 'WEDGED=vendor-specific' for such errors.
Vendors must provide additional recovery documentation if this method
is used.

It is the responsibility of the consumer to refer to the correct vendor
specific documentation and usecase before attempting a recovery.

For example: If driver is XE KMD, the consumer must refer
to the documentation of 'Device Wedging' under 'Documentation/gpu/xe/'.

v2: fix documentation (Raag)
v3: add more details to commit message (Sima, Rodrigo, Raag)
    add an example script to the documentation (Raag)
v4: use consistent naming (Raag)
v5: fix commit message
v6: add more documentation

+Vendor Specific Recovery
+------------------------
+
+When ``WEDGED=vendor-specific`` is sent, it indicates that the device requires
+a recovery procedure specific to the hardware vendor and is not one of the
+standardized approaches.
+
+``WEDGED=vendor-specific`` may be used to indicate different cases within a
+single vendor driver, each requiring a distinct recovery procedure.
+In such scenarios, the vendor driver must provide comprehensive documentation
+that describes each case, include additional hints to identify specific case and
+outline the corresponding recovery procedure. The documentation includes:
+
+Case - A list of all cases that sends the ``WEDGED=vendor-specific`` recovery method.
+
+Hints - Additional Information to assist the userspace consumer in identifying and
+differentiating between different cases. This can be exposed through sysfs, debugfs,
+traces, dmesg etc.
+
+Recovery Procedure - Clear instructions and guidance for recovering each case.
+This may include userspace scripts, tools needed for the recovery procedure.
+
+It is the responsibility of the admin/userspace consumer to identify the case and
+verify additional identification hints before attempting a recovery procedure.
+
+Example: If the device uses the Xe driver, then userspace consumer should refer to
+:ref:`Xe Device Wedging <xe-device-wedging>` for the detailed documentation.
