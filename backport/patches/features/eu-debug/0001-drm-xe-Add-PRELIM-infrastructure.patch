Subject: drm/xe: Add PRELIM infrastructure

* Add xe_drm_prelim.h for maintaining internal/downstream declarations
  separate from upstream declarations in xe_drm.h. Because xe_drm_prelim.h
  struct declarations can use upstream struct declarations, xe_drm_prelim.h
  is included at the bottom of xe_drm.h.
* Add some PRELIM ioctl helpers

+/**
+ * DOC: Xe PRELIM uAPI
+ *
+ * Reasoning:
+ *
+ * The DRM community imposes some strict requirements on the uAPI:
+ *
+ * - https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/gpu/drm-uapi.html#open-source-userspace-requirements
+ * - "The open-source userspace must not be a toy/test application, but the real thing."
+ * - "The userspace patches must be against the canonical upstream, not some vendor fork."
+ *
+ * In some very specific cases, there will be a particular need to get a preliminary and
+ * non-upstream uAPI merged in some of our branches. When this happens, the uAPI cannot
+ * take a risk of conflicting IOCTL ranges with other preliminary uAPI or with a possible
+ * real user space uAPI that could win the race towards upstream.
+ *
+ * 'PRELIM' uAPIs are APIs that are not yet merged on upstream. They were designed to be
+ * in a different range in a way that the divergence with the upstream and other development
+ * branches can be controlled and the conflicts minimized.
+ *
+ * It is also a mechanism that prevents user space regressions since the prelim modification
+ * is always in a two-phase approach, where upstream and prelim can coexist for a period of
+ * time while the UMDs adjust to the changes.
+ *
+ * Rules:
+ *
+ * - Communication will happen on a specific Teams channel: KMD uAPI Changes
+ * - APIs to be considered Preliminary / WIP / Temporary to what will eventually be in upstream.
+ *   It's designed to allow kernel and userspace to work together and make sure it works with all
+ *   components before committing to support it forever in upstream (we don't want to break Linux's
+ *   rule about not breaking userspace).
+ * - IOCTL in separate file (this one).
+ * - IOCTL, flags, enums, or any number that might conflict should be in separated range
+ *   (i.e end of range like IOCTL numbers).
+ * - PRELIM prefix mandatory in any define, struct, or non-static functions in PRELIM source files
+ *   called by other source files (i.e xe_perf_ioctl -> prelim_xe_perf_ioctl)
+ * - Code .c/.h using PRELIM should also be placed in prelim/ sub-directory for easier rebase.
+ * - Two-Phase removal:
+ *
+ *   + When API needs to be modified in non-backwards compatible ways, the current PRELIM API
+ *     cannot be removed (yet).
+ *   + Either because it must change the behavior or because the final upstream one has landed.
+ *   + If a new PRELIM is needed, it needs to be added as a new PRELIM_V<n+1> without removing the
+ *     PRELIM_V<n>.
+ *   + The previous one can only be removed after all user space components confirmed they are not
+ *     using.
+ *
+ * Other prelim considerations:
+ *
+ * - Out of tree Sysfs and debugfs need to stay behind a 'prelim' directory.
+ * - Out of tree module-parameters need to be identified by a PRELIM prefix.
+ *   (xe.prelim_my_awesome_param=not_default)
+ * - Internal/downstream declarations must be added here, not to xe_drm.h.
+ * - The values in xe_drm_prelim.h must also be kept synchronized with values in xe_drm.h.
+ * - PRELIM ioctl's: IOCTL numbers go down from 0x5f
+ */
+
+/*
+ * IOCTL numbers listed below are reserved, they are taken up by other
+ * components. Please add an unreserved ioctl number here to reserve that
+ * number.
